# Mission

Create a web application development strategy to maximize productivity by leveraging the power of agentic assistants.

## Customer Requirements

- A complete, full-stack solution
- An opinionated, architectural strategy
- Elegantly simple and intuitive to use
- Zero-config out of the box
- Very few 3rd-party dependencies
- Fun to use

## Vision

This is just a project I'm doing for fun, because I love coding and engineering solutions. There are many, enterprise-level solutions out there that you should use for production environments and this is NOT one of them (yet). I'm doing this because I like coding-freedom and I want to learn all the technical intricacies of web application development. I'm heavily leveraging LLMs and agentic assistants because this is the AI era now. 🤘
